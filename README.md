# Monty Hall Game Simulator
A simulator that demonstrates probability in the Monty Hall problem popularized by 
the famous game show Let's Make a Deal which originally aired from 1963 until 1986. 
The gist of the game is that a contestant is presented with three doors. Behind 
two of the doors, there are goats, while one of the doors hides a nice prize 
like a brand new car. The twist to this game is that after a contestant picks 
a door, the host will then open one of the remaining doors revealing goats. The 
guest is then asked if she wants to switch to the remaining door or keep her 
initial guess. The question is, is it better to stick to your initial guess or 
make the switch?

## Running the Simulator
This repo consists of a script that runs the simulation and an R notebook where you can
view results `simulator_nb.Rmd`.
